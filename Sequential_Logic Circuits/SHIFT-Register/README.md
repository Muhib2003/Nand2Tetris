# SISO4 - 4-bit Serial-In Serial-Out Shift Register

## Overview

The **SISO4** is a 4-bit Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) shift register. It is a fundamental sequential logic circuit used for temporary data storage and transfer in digital systems. The SISO shift register accepts data serially (one bit at a time) and outputs the data serially after a fixed number of clock cycles.

## Features

- **4-bit storage**: Can store and shift 4 bits of data.
- **Serial input and output**: Data is shifted in and out one bit per clock cycle.
- **Synchronous operation**: All flip-flops are triggered by the same clock signal.


## Applications

- Data serialization and deserialization
- Temporary data storage
- Data transfer between subsystems
- Delay circuits
- Sequence generation
