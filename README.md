# Nand2Tetris
This repository contains my implementations of elementary logic gates as part of the Nand2Tetris course. These gates form the foundation of digital circuits and are essential for building more complex computational components.
## Overview

This project includes the implementation of fundamental logic gates using only NAND gates. following the principles of hardware description language (HDL) in Nand2Tetris.

Completed Projects:
Basic Gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR,Multi bit busses.

Multiplexers and Demultiplexers: MUX, DMUX

Arithmetic Components: Half Adder, Full Adder,Add16.tion 
Aritmatic Logic Unit(ALU).


Sequential Logic Circuits:
1-bit Register

16-bit Register

Program Counter.

Skills Learned:
Hardware Description Language.
Digital Logic Design.
Simulation using Logisim.
