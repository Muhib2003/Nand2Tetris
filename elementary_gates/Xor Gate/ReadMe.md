#  XOR GATE
## Overview
Xor.hdl is a simple hardware description file for Xor gate(Exclusive Or gate).It's implemented using simple HDL language which is specially developed for nand2tetris course. Xor gate is a fundamental logic gate for digital circuit that implements following truth table.

### Truth Table

| a | b |out|   
| 0 | 0 | 0 |   
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   
| 1 | 0 | 1 |   
| 1 | 1 | 0 |   

Here a and b are the two inputs and that gives an output.
